Image Slider Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

-Overview :

This project showcases a simple image slider (carousel) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider allows users to navigate through a series of images using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. It demonstrates the basics of front-end development, including DOM manipulation with JavaScript and styling with CSS.

-Features :

Responsive Design: The slider is designed to adapt to different screen sizes.

Next/Previous Navigation: Users can click buttons to navigate between images.

Autoplay: The slider automatically cycles through images after a set time interval.

Smooth Transitions: Transitions between images are animated for a smooth user experience.

-Technologies Used :

HTML5: For the structure and layout of the slider.

CSS3: For styling the slider and adding animations.

JavaScript (ES6): For handling the image transitions, navigation, and autoplay functionality.

-Project Structure :

index.html: The main HTML file that includes the structure for the slider.

style.css: The CSS file that styles the slider, buttons, and overall layout.

script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the slider's behavior, such as switching images and autoplay.

-How it Works :

Image Display: Images are placed in a container, and only one image is visible at a time.

Button Navigation: JavaScript handles "Next" and "Previous" button clicks to navigate through the images.

Autoplay: The slider automatically switches images at a set interval using JavaScript's setInterval function.

CSS Transitions: CSS adds smooth transitions between images for a polished look.

-How to Run the Project :

Clone this repository or download the project files.

Replace the placeholder images (img1.jpg, img2.jpg, etc.) in the HTML with your own image files.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the images, or let the slider autoplay.

-Future Enhancements :

Add support for touch/swipe gestures for better mobile usability.

Allow dynamic addition of images using JavaScript.

Add dots or indicators at the bottom of the slider to show the current slide.

Implement lazy loading of images to improve performance for larger image sets.
